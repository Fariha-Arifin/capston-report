\section{Summary}

In this project, we present a novel ensemble based classification method and a web base tool based on feature subspacing and apply it for solving anticancer peptide prediction problem. On the standard benchmark dataset, our method produces significantly better results compared to single weak classifiers and outperforms most other state-of-the-art predictors. However, there are still a room to improve in terms of accuracy. We believe, more effective feature space and feature selection might result into more effective classifier.

\section{Limitation}

We have time constraints, that we may need more time to more feature selection to achieve the higher accuracy we want but we have time limitation to finish the work. We are using free software so there is no constraint on that part. Even for using dataset we do not need to take any permission as it is open for anyone to use.

\section{Future Work}
In future we will apply feature selection to increase our present accuracy and try to apply our model on independent dataset. We will try to find more features and try to apply this subspacing method on various types of datasets. We will increase tool's usability and also try to publish it as a journal.
