Anticancer peptides have emerged as new effective method for treatment of cancer due to their high precision. As they are not toxic to normal cells they are preferred over traditional methods and therapy and hence discovery of anticancer peptides has found importance among biologists. However, the laboratory methods are still time consuming and cost-ineffective. In this project, we create a tool and propose a novel ensemble classification algorithm to predict anticancer property of peptides based on their primary amino acid sequences. Our ensemble divides the feature space into subspaces and thus each weak classifiers based on the subspaces and provides the final prediction using majority voting. We have tested the performance of the method on standard benchmark dataset. Our method is significantly better than most other state-of-the-art methods for anticancer peptide prediction.
