Due to the tremendous growth of network-based services and large volume of security audit data as well as the complex and dynamic properties of intrusion behaviours, several data mining-based intrusion detection techniques have been applied to network-based traffic data and host-based program behaviors to detect intrusions or misuse patterns in the last decades. However, there remain various issues that are needed to be examined towards current intrusion detection system (IDS) such as correct classification of large intrusion detection dataset, unbalanced detection rates in the high speed network traffic, large numbers of false positives, and redundant attributes that will lead to the complexity of detection model and degradation of detection accuracy. In this thesis, several learning algorithms based on data mining for adaptive intrusion detection have been presented, which scale up the balance detection rates (DR) for different types of network intrusions and reduce the false positives (FP) at acceptable level in intrusion detection. The proposed algorithms also address some difficulties of data mining such as handling continuous attributes, dealing with missing attribute values, reducing noise in training dataset, and eliminating redundant input attributes as well as contradictory examples from training dataset that make the detection model complex. The performance of the proposed algorithms have been tested with existing data mining algorithms by employing on the KDD99 benchmark intrusion detection dataset. The experimental analysis prove that the proposed algorithms achieve high DR and significantly reduce the number and percentage of FP for different types of network intrusions using limited computational resources. The main purpose of this thesis is to improve the performance of na\"\i ve Bayesian classifier and decision tree algorithm for intrusion detection that is computationally efficient and effective.
